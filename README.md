# Scoober Sync

A simple application that automatically syncs my scoober(takeaway.com)
schedule with my (google) calendar.

This app requires you to have `SCOOBER_EMAIL` and `SCOOBER_PASSWORD`
in your env variables.

You will also need a google api app with the calendar api enabled.
Place the `credentials.json` file in the working directory. Or
whatever you have set in the environment variable `DATA`.
